# LinearSearchSimulation_usingTM
 A group project (as part of our academic coursework - **CSPC41**: Formal Languages and Automata Theory) where our team designed a **two-way, single-track Turing machine** that simulates linear search on a given set of inputs and returns the corresponding index if an element exists. 
The transition table and helper functions were implemented in **C++**. 

**Do note:-**
* The **seminarIntro.pdf** contains the basic input and output style for our TM.
* The **Automata Project.pdf** contains the reasoning as well as the final transition table for our TM. In addition, it contains our choice of action in various edge-cases.
* Compile and run **LinearSearch_TM.cpp** to view our simulation, step-by-step.
